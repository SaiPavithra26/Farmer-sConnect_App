Farmer’s Connect App is a digital platform designed to help small-scale farmers directly connect with buyers and access essential agricultural support services. The application eliminates middlemen by enabling transparent, secure, and efficient farmer–buyer interactions through a modern marketplace system.

The platform supports role-based authentication for farmers, buyers, and administrators using JWT security. Farmers can list their produce, upload images, manage inventory, negotiate prices via in-app messaging, and receive payments through UPI integration. Buyers can discover nearby farmers using GPS-based matching and purchase products based on quality, quantity, and location preferences.

Key features include weather updates and market trend analysis to support better decision-making, multilingual support, offline access, and a simple, intuitive UI designed for rural and semi-literate users. Community discussion boards and learning modules provide knowledge on sustainable farming practices, crop management, and financial literacy.

The app also includes verified buyer profiles, transaction history, and a complaint resolution system to ensure trust and transparency across the supply chain. Integrated logistics coordination helps reduce post-harvest losses and improve delivery efficiency, while analytics dashboards provide insights into pricing trends and buyer behavior.
